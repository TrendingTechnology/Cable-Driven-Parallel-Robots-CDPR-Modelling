CDPR : Cable based parallel manipulator

This project was created as a part of ENPM 662 -- Introduction to robot modelling course project. This project was created by,

1] Saumil Shah -- Robotics graduate student student at University of Maryland, College Park.

2] Mahmoud Dahmani -- Robotics graduate student at University of Maryland, College Park.

With increasing demand of automation in warehouses and mass manufacturing facilities, more and more robots are being used to do several tasks in such environments. These
tasks include moving big packages or heavy loads in metal industry. In metal or manufacturing industry,usually hand type serial manipulators are used on larger scale. Because
of their smaller workspace, number of such robots have to be incorporated. For moving
packages, serial manipulators are being used with automatic guided vehicles which again
complicates the whole process.

This repository consists of source code used to simulate the mathematics derived as a part of the project. You can read the final report of the project [here](https://github.com/SaumilShah66/CDPR-Robot-modelling-project/blob/master/Report.pdf). You can find the videos and other important information used in report [here](https://github.com/SaumilShah66/CDPR-Robot-modelling-project/tree/master/results).
